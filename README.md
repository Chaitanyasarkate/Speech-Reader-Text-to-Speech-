ANALYZE AND GIVE ME DESCRIPTION FOR THISS PROJECT
Project Description: Text-to-Speech (TTS) Converter with Voice Selection
A web-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) application that converts user-input text into spoken audio using the browser's built-in Web Speech API. This project allows users to select from multiple available voices (system-dependent) and customize their listening experience.

Key Features
âœ… Text-to-Speech Conversion â€“ Converts written text into spoken words using SpeechSynthesisUtterance.
âœ… Multi-Voice Support â€“ Dynamically loads available system voices (male/female, different languages).
âœ… Responsive UI â€“ Clean, centered layout with smooth transitions and focus states.
âœ… Custom Voice Selection â€“ Dropdown menu populated with available voices (e.g., "Google US English," "Microsoft Zira").
âœ… Modern Styling â€“ Gradient background, rounded corners, and subtle shadows for a polished look.

Tech Stack
Frontend:

HTML5 â€“ Structure for text input, dropdown, and button.

CSS3 â€“ Flexbox layout, gradient background, and hover effects.

JavaScript (Web Speech API) â€“ Powers speech synthesis and voice selection.

How It Works
User Input:

Types/pastes text into the <textarea>.

Voice Selection:

Chooses a preferred voice from the dropdown (auto-populated via speechSynthesis.getVoices()).

Speech Generation:

Clicking "Speak" triggers textToSpeech(), which converts text to audio using the selected voice.

Code Breakdown
index.html
Contains a textarea (for input), dropdown (voice selection), and button (to trigger speech).

Linked to style.css (styling) and script.js (functionality).

style.css
Gradient Background (#d3c0a0 to #5c5b5b) for a warm, neutral aesthetic.

Consistent Styling â€“ Rounded borders, box shadows, and hover effects on interactive elements.

Responsive Centering â€“ Uses flexbox to align content vertically and horizontally.

script.js
populateVoiceList() â€“ Fetches available voices and updates the dropdown.

textToSpeech() â€“ Converts text to speech using the selected voice.

Event Handling â€“ Automatically loads voices when the page initializes (onvoiceschanged).

Possible Use Cases
Accessibility Tool â€“ Helps visually impaired users hear written content.

Language Learning â€“ Listen to pronunciation in different accents/languages.

Proofreading Assistant â€“ Hear written text to catch errors.

Voice-Enabled Apps â€“ Can be extended for chatbots, narrations, or voice assistants.
